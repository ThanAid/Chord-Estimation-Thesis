# Abstract

This thesis presents an innovative approach to audio chord recognition, aiming to
automatically identify and classify fundamental chord structures within music pieces.
Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (biLSTM) layers, advanced feature engineering, and post-processing techniques
rooted in music theory, our research enhances the accuracy and robustness of chord
recognition systems. By extracting features from chord representations such as root,
bass, and triad qualities, and segmenting the problem into distinct components, our
framework creates a solid ground to enhance the accuracy of chord recognition. Ad-
ditionally, we employ transfer learning techniques to capitalize on pre-trained models,
fine-tuning them for our specific chord recognition task, thus improving generalization
and robustness. Moreover, our exploration encompasses various Fourier transforms for
feature extraction, including Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Constant Q Trans-
form (CQT), to capture essential information from audio signals and optimize chord recog-
nition performance. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation of different CNN
and biLSTM configurations, as well as post-processing techniques, our approach demon-
strates significant enhancements in several aspectes of chord recognition. Overall, this
research contributes a comprehensive framework that leverages deep learning method-
ologies, sophisticated feature engineering, and post-processing techniques, showcasing
its potential to advance music information retrieval systems.
